# User Groups

Since you can have multiple users on a single system, the information about each user has to be stored, which exists at `/etc/passwd`

You can view all users with

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

Groups in Unix offer a way to share files with certain users but deny access to all others. The idea is that you
can set read or write permission bits for a particular group, excluding everyone else. This feature was once
important because many users shared one machine, but itâ€™s become less significant in recent years as
workstations are shared less often

You can view the groups your user is part of with the command `groups`
```bash
$ groups
mitch adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lxd
```
