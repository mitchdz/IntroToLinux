# Memory State

Memory is just a big storage of _bits_ being either 0 or 1.

All processes have a state such as `0110` `0001` `1011` but this is hard to remember as there are many states, so often times instead of saying the state a process is in you might say "The process is waiting for input" or "the process has halted".
